# Extract section data and tranports

The **Section/** subdirectory contain routines for extracting data from sections to NetCDF files, and routines
for calculating transport estimates from hycom files. There are several programs in this directory, but their
functionality is most easily accessed using three different scripts; they are **m2section**, **m2transport** and
**m2transport2**.
