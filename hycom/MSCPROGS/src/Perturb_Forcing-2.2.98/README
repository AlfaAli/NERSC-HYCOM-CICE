Routines described in this README:

force_perturb-2.2    - perturb existing forcing fields  with random forcing
------------------
In this directory is the routine force_perturb-2.2. This routine simply 
adds time-dependent perturbations on existing forcing files. it reads
infile2.in to get variances  of  random forcing ++, and applies them to
existing forcing fields. Results are put in files with names a la 
tst.forcing.airtmp.[ab]
The call method is similar to forfun_nersc
