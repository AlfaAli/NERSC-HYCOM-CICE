! This program reads information about the model grid (lon-lat-depth-dimensions)
! and amplitudes and phases for 8 constituents from a global grid, and interpolates
! these to the model boundary grid points and save the result to a file
! CSRobc_tide.dat which is read by HYCOM to compute the tidal boundary conditions.
!
! It reads the following files:
!    regional.grid.[ab]  --- contains model lon lat positions.
!    regional.depth.[ab] --- model bathymetry.
!    ortho_csr_4.0.ot    --- tidal amplitudes and phases for 8 constituents
!    input.usr           --- user specified constituents to include (DO NOT ALTER)
!
! Path to ortho_csr_4.0.ot is specified by environment variable CSR_PATH
!
! Grid dimensions are retrieved from regional.grid.b.
!
! Output is dumped to CSRobc_tide.dat
!
! Diagnostic output of phase and amplitude is dumped to csrtide.nc
!
! -Originally developed by Knud Simonsen, and later adapted and modified
!     by Geir Evensen,   Geir.Evensen@nersc.no
! -Modified for regional.grid/depth files by Knut Liseter. Grid sizes
!    are determined by values in regional.grid.b. Added netcdf diafgnostics
!    Generic makefile with arch-dependent includes from ../Make.Inc/make.inc
!    Path to CSR data files now more flexible, it is specified through the
!    environment variable CSR_PATH. input.CSR files can be found in 
!    Infiles of src directory
