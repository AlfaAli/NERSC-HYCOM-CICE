This routine contains routines for producing tidal forcing of
the hycom model, and for visualizing fes data (mainly fes2nc).

Make sure the environment variable "FES_PATH" is set when you 
run the routines. It points to the directory containing the FES 
data. (Relative to this dir it is ../FES2004/data).

The main routines are:

fes2mod : Produces input files for forcing hycom
fes2nc  : Puts FES data into a netcdf file for visualization

See ../Inti_README.txt for more info on running fes2mod

Also, see Inti_notes.doc in this directory for more info, altough
some of that isnt 100% correct in this setup (some refer to routines
in ../FES2004/src)


for fes2nc:
Make sure that netcdf libraries and compilers are consistent. 
Use gnu compilers and libraries if present

If it doen not compile, it may be that libfes.a is not yet compiled, try this:
cd hycom/MSCPROGS/src_others/FES2004/src/
make clean
make install
cd ~/hycom/MSCPROGS/src/Tides_FES/nersc_src
make clean
make install
