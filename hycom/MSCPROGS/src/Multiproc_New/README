multiproc_new:
   multiproc converts a set of weekly average files to
   means, and dumps the data in the old "pak" format. It also
   dumps the meanssh.uf files which are used by many data
   assimilation routines.  List the files to process (one per line)
   in the file "multiproc.in".

   Pak-files have low precision, and in addition the
   other routines in the src directory do not accept pak-files
   any longer.  For snapshots other than restart files you are
   better off with the archv format.
   (However, if you insist on using pak-files, look at the routines
   under Old, which where used before teh current setup)

   If you want mean ssh there are better 
   ways of calculating it (use for instance the "Average" routine 
   in the src directory

   The use of multiproc is discouraged.
