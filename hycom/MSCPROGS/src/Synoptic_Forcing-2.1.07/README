This directory contains routines for converting from various types of 
atmospheric forcing datasets to a format that is understood by HYCOM. 
It has been tested mainly with the NERSC version of HYCOM. Available
data sets are

Synoptic forcing:
option era40 - ERA40 datasets
Option ncepr - NCEP reanalysis
Option ecmwf  
Option metno  
Option ecnc  - These are various ecmwf operational datasets

Climatology :
option era40 - Climatology based on ERA40 forcing
Option old   - Old climatology based on COADS, Legates & Vilmott ++ 

For running this, you need to have a infile.in for the NERSC version
of HYCOM (it contains forcing information). You also need to set up
paths locally to the atmospheric forcing data sets. Run the routine 
where you run your model, and forcing.* - files will be created.
You will also need bathymetry and model grid:
regional.grid.[ab]
regional.depth.[ab]


Call the routine like this:
   synoptic_forcing-2.1 [synoptic option] [climatology option]
Example:
   synoptic_forcing-2.1 era40 era40
The forcing will then be created for the time period specified
in infile.in



This version is meant for NERSC HYCOM version 2.1 - For newer versions
you should use the version in Synoptic_Forcing-2.2
