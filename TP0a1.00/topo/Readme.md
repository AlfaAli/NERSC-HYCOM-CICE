# Generating the CICE grid files.
Having the ocean grid files (regional.grid.[ab], depth_TP0a1.00_01.[ab], and grid.info), the file **kmt_TP0a1.00_01.nc** can be generated by calling [cice_kmt.sh](https://github.com/nansencenter/NERSC-HYCOM-CICE/blob/master/bin/cice_kmt.sh). The file **cice_grid.nc** is generated by the python routine [hycom_grid.py](https://github.com/nansencenter/NERSC-HYCOM-CICE/blob/master/bin/hycom_grid.py).  Both of these files are needed for CICE.
